#  The FOR LOOP in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) and
#  other objects

# 1. Print individual letter of a string using the FOR LOOP

word = 'Python'
for letter in word:
    print(letter)

word2 = input('Enter a word: ')
for l in word2:
        print(l)

# Using the FOR LOOP to iterate over Python list or Tuple

# create a vaiable to store the sum
