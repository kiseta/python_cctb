# PYTHON ERROR HANDLING REVIEW

# step 1 define program requirements
# Integer division program requirements:
# program requires 2 numbers
# step 2 create a basic program
# step 3 test your program with all possible inputs (hardcoded):
# correct input (integers within the range), incorrect input: letters, and zero, negative numbers are ok
# determine the error codes: ValueError
# once your program is tested and working use the try, except finally statement as follows:
# your program goes into try: block
# error code(s) go into except: block(s)
# test your program again to confirm the errors are being caught and handled.
# print user-friendly messages to inform of the results.

# PYTHON IMPORT
# In Python, you use the 'import' keyword to make code in one module available in another.
# Imports in Python are important for structuring your code effectively.
# Using imports properly will make you more productive,
# allowing you to reuse code while keeping your projects maintainable.

# 1. TIME
# Python module called 'time' - add to the VERY top of the file: import time

current_date = time.asctime()
print('-----------------------------')
print(f'Test Started: {current_date}')

# create a ticking timer using sleep() function, add to the top of the file: from time import sleep
# prompt = print(input('Initiate self-destruct? (Yes/No)'))
#
# if prompt == 'Yes':
seconds = 10
while seconds != 0:
    print(f'Time to self-destruct: {seconds} sec')
    seconds -= 1
    # seconds -=1
    sleep(1) # requires import: add to top of the file: from time import sleep

print(f'ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ BOOM! ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ')
# else:
#     print(f'Self-distract aborted!')

# 2. COPY
# Python module called 'copy'  - add to the top of the file: import copy

name_list = ['Bryan', 'Kate', 'Maria', 'Alice', 'Jayson'] # make a list of items
new_list = copy(name_list)
print(new_list)

# 3. RANDOM

# Python module called 'random'  - add to the top of the file: import random
# method to generate random integer numbers is RANDINT
a = random.randint(1111,9999)
print(f'The random int is {a}')

# Program to generate random integers based on user input
x = int(input('Enter a number for the lowest value in range: '))
y = int(input('Enter a number for the highest value in range: '))
z = random.randint(x,y)

print(f'Generate random integer from to {x, y}')
print(f'The random dynamic int number is: {z}')

# Program to generate float number using random/library
f = random.uniform(1.5, 7.5)

# Program to generate random float numbers based on user input
start_n = float(input('Enter a number for the lowest value in range: '))

# External Python library called 'Faker'
# to use, requires 3 steps:
# Step 1 Instal Faker Library via Python Packages installer
# Step 2 Add to the top of the file: from faker import Faker
# Step 3 Initialize the library - create a variable and set the locale: fake = Faker(locale='en_CA')
# To use:
email = fake.email()
print(email)
address = fake.address()#.replace('\n', " ")
print(address)
print(address.replace('\n', " "))
